## Problem Title
SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms
## Problem Description
### Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

### Problem Description

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:

• Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions.
• Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems.
• Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition.
• Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches.
• Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas.

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

### Expected Outcomes

• Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity.
• Improved risk management at the farm level as well as self-assessment.
• Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines.
• Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking.
• Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers.
• Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity.
• Empowerment of small and marginal farmers with limited resources.
• Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy making.
• Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem.
• Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases.

## Proposed Solution
We propose to develop a user-friendly system to solve the given problem effectively.
The solution will be built as a (web app / mobile app / AI model / IoT system) depending on the requirement.
It will include essential features such as data collection, processing, analysis, and real-time output.
The system will use modern technologies like AI/ML, cloud computing, databases, APIs, and automation tools.
Our approach will ensure accuracy, faster processing, and reduced manual effort.
The workflow will be simple, starting from input collection → processing → output generation.
The solution is designed to be scalable, so it can handle more users or data in the future.
It provides a secure and reliable architecture with proper authentication and data protection.

## Technical Approach
We will use a modular architecture so each part of the system can be developed and tested independently.
The frontend will be built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React / Flutter for a smooth user interface.
The backend will use Node.js / Python / Java to handle data processing and server operations.
A database such as MySQL / MongoDB / Firebase will be used to store user data securely.
We will integrate APIs for communication between frontend and backend.
If needed, we will apply AI/ML algorithms to analyze data and generate predictions or insights.
We will follow a step-by-step development process:
Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment.
The system will use secure authentication (JWT, OAuth, etc.) to protect user data.

## Feasibility and Viability
The solution is technically feasible using currently available tools and technologies.
Our team has the required skills (programming, AI, UI/UX, hardware, etc.) to develop the solution.
The project can be completed within the SIH timeline.
Required resources such as laptops, software, and internet are easily available.
The solution is cost-effective and does not require expensive hardware.
It can be easily adopted by the users or the organization.
The solution is scalable and can grow with more users or data.
Regular maintenance is simple and low-cost.

## Impact and Benefits
The solution will significantly improve efficiency in the existing system.
It reduces manual work and saves time for users or the organization.
It increases accuracy and reduces errors in the process.
The system brings digital transformation to the current workflow.
It makes operations smoother, faster, and more transparent.
The solution can positively impact a large number of people/users.
It supports scalability and modernization in the future.
It helps decision-makers with better data, insights, or automation.
